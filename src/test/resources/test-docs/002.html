		<h1>Veganism</h1>
		<div readability-result>
			<p><b>Veganism</b> is both the practice of abstaining from the use of <a>animal
				products</a>, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the
				<a>commodity status of animals</a>.<sup><a>[b]</a></sup> A follower of either the
				diet or the philosophy is known as a <b>vegan</b> (
				<small>pronounced</small>
				<span><a><i><b><span><span>VEE</span></span></b>-g…ôn</i></a></span>).
			</p>
			<p>Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. <i>Dietary
				vegans</i> (or strict <a>vegetarians</a>) refrain from consuming animal products,
				not only meat but also <a>eggs</a>, <a>dairy products</a> and other animal-derived
				substances.<sup><a>[c]</a></sup> The term <i>ethical vegan</i> is often applied to
				those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of
				their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose.<sup><a>[d]</a></sup>
				Another term is <i><a>environmental veganism</a></i>, which refers to the avoidance
				of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of
				animals is environmentally damaging and <a>unsustainable</a>.<sup><a>[17]</a></sup>
