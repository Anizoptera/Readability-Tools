		<h1>Veganism</h1>
		<div readability-result>
			<p>Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products,
				particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status
				of animals. A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan
				(pronounced vee-g…ôn).</p>
			<p>Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary
				vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat
				but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical
				vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the
				philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any
				purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of
				animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals
				is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.</p>
